 # Hello! I’m Jordan aka @jordancodesforfun
 I'm a college student interested in anylisis of voter trends. Ive taken some classes on R, but most of my
   knolledge on any language is self-taught through books or Chat GBT. Most of what you will find on my profile
   is me playing with data I found somewhere or tables I created that might be of interest. Appreciate any feedback
   on what I can do better!
